# Keep Ya Beat desktop version

Now a legacy project. A desktop version of the Android app. 

Still available for download from the Keep Ya Beat website, however the executables are quite old and I'm no longer supporting them.

A lightweight java games library (LWJGL) project implemented with Slick2D. The building blocks for the GUI components are from the Themeable Widget Library (TWL). There are many customisations, inventions and cool features. You can read about it on the website and also see the legacy project videos on the you tube channel (links on the website too).
