run it a bunch of times and at although does quite well, specially with few points,
eventually runs into a problem where it would be better to replace a section of the cycle and redo it in a shorter way given the new point.
problem is how to test for the existence of such an optimisation... there's no info that can make it an easy thing to find, perhaps every section
of the whole thing needs to be re-evaluated.

ideas
is there something about when this happens that makes it possible to detect?
eg. some place where a bridge is likely to create a shorter route and a section that gets cut out then needs to be remade and spliced in somehow?
perhaps proximity of edges or vertices which aren't connected?
