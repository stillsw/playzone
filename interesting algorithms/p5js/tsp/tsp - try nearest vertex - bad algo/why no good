the idea is to find the nearest vertex to the added one, connect to it and then figure out the best one of that vertex's existing sides to eliminate

sounds reasonable but fails because, say get point d in this pic, nearest vertex is a, but obviously don't want to splice in to either of a's edges


                          a
                      /       \
                  /               \
              /                        \
          /                                \ 
      /                                        \
  /                                                \
