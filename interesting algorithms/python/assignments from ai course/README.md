This MOOC was really interesting, but the assignments required coding up skeletal parts within a provided framework. 

Because of that not all on the code here is my own, however, I've kept it in its entirety in case someone wants to try running them. The highlight for me was getting the Pacman agents to react intelligently.

There's a readme file under week 9 that explains how to run some of the assignments.
