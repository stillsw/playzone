A self directed project that started out being about learning how to make game loops, and ended up being a bouncing balls type of game. This is old now, it pre-dates learning about game engines and Android.

I had to learn many concepts and methods and incorporate them in this game:

Game loops and how to keep animations and rendering smooth (before using any kind of engine)

Collision detection, including advanced topics such as tunneling (where an object that is moving fast has the potential of bypassing a collision) and physics based transferrence of momentum.

Trigonometric and vector based maths for projections of movement and such. I chose to write my own classes for this for the fun of learning it.
